# GAN-based-State-Predictor
Predict and and analyse the state of a power plant, and mitigate the effects in case of any emergency. The dataset is kept private for time being.
As all possilbe combinations of the parameters can't be simulated and analysed to train the disccriminator, a GAN is used to create fake data which is inturn used to train the discriminator to obtain better results.
